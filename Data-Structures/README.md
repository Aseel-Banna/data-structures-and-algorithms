# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

## Challenge

Create a Node class with two properties head and value.
Create methods to deal with linked lists such as insert, includes, and toString.

## Approach & Efficiency
Node O(1)
insert, includes and toString O(n)

## API

insert: adding values to the linked list
includes: search for a certain value if it exists in a linked list
toString: print out all elements in the linked list
