# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

## Challenge

Create a Node class with two properties head and value.
Create methods to deal with linked lists such as insert, includes, and toString.

## Approach & Efficiency
Node O(1)
insert, includes and toString O(n)

## API

insert: adding values to the linked list
includes: search for a certain value if it exists in a linked list
toString: print out all elements in the linked list

# Challenge 6

Implement different insertion methods to linked list:
1. ***append(value)*** which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
2. ***insertBefore(value, newVal)*** which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
3. ***insertAfter(value, newVal)*** which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
Node O(1)
insert, includes and toString O(n)

## API

insert: adding values to the linked list
includes: search for a certain value if it exists in a linked list
toString: print out all elements in the linked list
append(value)*** which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

# Challenge 7

Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1)

## API

insert: adding values to the linked list
includes: search for a certain value if it exists in a linked list
toString: print out all elements in the linked list
append(value)*** which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
returnValue (position) which return the data of the inserted position

# Challenge 8

Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1)

## API

insert: adding values to the linked list
includes: search for a certain value if it exists in a linked list
toString: print out all elements in the linked list
append(value)*** which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
returnValue (position) which return the data of the inserted position
zipLists(LinkedList list) which merged two linked list together
