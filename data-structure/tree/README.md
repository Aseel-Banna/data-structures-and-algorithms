# Trees
This lab is about trees and its methods and how to traverse over them.

## Challenge
Created a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree with methods.

## Approach and Efficiency
### Binary Tree methods
* For traversals, the Big O is O(n) for both time and space complexities, because they use recursion and arrayLists respectively. 

### Binary Search Tree methods
* Add and contains method are O(log n) for time, because it keeps searching the half part of tree.

## API
### Tree
* Initialization example: Tree<Integer> sample = new Tree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. preOrder - it prints the root, left then right.
2. inOrder - it prints left, root then right.
3. postOrder - it prints left, right then root.

### Binary Search Tree
* Initialization example: BinaryTree<Integer> sample = new BinarySearchTree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. add - it adds a new node with its value.
2. contains - it searches for a given value in the tree.4

# Challenge 16: Find Maximum in a Binary Tree

## Challenge
Find the maximum value in a binary tree.

## Approach and Efficiency
### Binary Tree methods
* For time complexity, the Big O is O(n), since it will loop over the hole tree to find the maximum value. 

## API
### Tree
* Initialization example: Tree<Integer> sample = new Tree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. preOrder - it prints the root, left then right.
2. inOrder - it prints left, root then right.
3. postOrder - it prints left, right then root.
4. findMaximumValue - it finds the maximum value in the tree. 

### Binary Search Tree
* Initialization example: BinaryTree<Integer> sample = new BinarySearchTree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. add - it adds a new node with its value.
2. contains - it searches for a given value in the tree.

# Challenge 17: Breadth-First Tree

## Challenge
Traverse an input tree using breadth-first method.

## Approach and Efficiency
### Binary Tree methods
* For time complexity, the Big O is O(n), since it will loop over the hole tree to find the maximum value. 

## API
### Tree
* Initialization example: Tree<Integer> sample = new Tree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. preOrder - it prints the root, left then right.
2. inOrder - it prints left, root then right.
3. postOrder - it prints left, right then root.
4. findMaximumValue - it finds the maximum value in the tree. 
5. breadthFirst - it traverse tree using breadth-first technique.

### Binary Search Tree
* Initialization example: BinaryTree<Integer> sample = new BinarySearchTree<>()` 
#### Methods
1. add - it adds a new node with its value.
2. contains - it searches for a given value in the tree.
